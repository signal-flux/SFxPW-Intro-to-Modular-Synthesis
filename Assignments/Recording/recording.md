# Recording a Short Composition

Now that you have learned the fundamental concpets and tools for modular synthesis and how to record, you can begin developing the skillset for composition! 

### Practice makes perfect 

Recording your ideas and taking corresponding patch notes will help you understand your music making workflow and the strategies you tend towards or shy away from. 

1. Use a dedicated notebook for documenting your patches with text and/or visual aids – whatever works best for you! 
2. Try [Patchbook](https://github.com/spektroaudio/patchbook) – a markup language and parser for writing and distributing patches for modular synthesizers created by Spektro Audio. 

### Questions to Ask Yourself
1. What will my sound sources be?
2. How will I control, create, or discover events, rhythm, and pitch? 
3. How will I process, sculpt, and evolve control voltage and sounds?

### Recording

1. Go to this [page](./recording.zip) to download a .zip file containing a lab to learn how to record in VCV Rack. 
2. Update your plugins in VCV Rack. 

*N.B.* For your reference, the recorder module in the patch is called Stereo Recorder from the NYSTHI plugin library.

### Share with the world

1. Record a 1-2 minute composition in VCV Rack. Export the .wav file and send to [info@signalflux.org](mailto:info@signalflux.org)!
2. Consider creating a free [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/artists) artist account to begin uploading and sharing your compositions.

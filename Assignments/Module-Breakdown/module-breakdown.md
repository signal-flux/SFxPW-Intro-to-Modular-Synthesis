# Module Breakdown

One of the most important tools as you become a synthesist is becoming self-sufficient.  No matter how much you think you know, you will never know anything!  Knowing *what to do* when you don't know something though is the most valuable tool you can have!  This assignment will help you develop that skill.

In class you were assigned a number - that number determines which modules you will be researching for the class this week.  They will all be from Ã‰milie Gillet's brilliant, influential line of open-source Eurorack modules under her *Mutable Instruments* brand name.  They are also available in VCV Rack under the brand name *Audible Instruments*.  If you complete the the assignment with the first module you've been assigned, try moving on to the "challenge" category!

**Modules**

1. Mutable Instruments Veils
2. Mutable Instruments Shades
3. Mutable Instruments Braids

**Modules (Challenge)**

1. Mutable Instruments Marbles
2. Mutable Instruments Grids
3. Mutable Instruments Frames

## Assignment, Pt. 1

Your goal is to learn the ins and outs of your assigned module.  You should be able to answer the following questions:

1. What 'kind' of module is it?  (for example: VCA, sequencer, envelope generator, etc.)
2. What does each input control (both interface elements and CV)?
3. Does it work with both audio and CV inputs?  
4. What kind of output does it produce?

Tools at your disposal:

1. Find the official manuals.
2. Find reviews of the modules.
3. Find video tutorials or demos of the module.
4. Search forums for threads about the module.
5. Talk to your classmates about it!
6. Once you have some sense of what it does, try firing the module up in VCV Rack and exploring it there, with manual in hand.



## Assignment, Pt. 2

Make a patch that incorporates your module!  The rest is up to you :)

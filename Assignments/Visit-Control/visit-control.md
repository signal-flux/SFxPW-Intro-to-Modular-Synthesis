# Visit Control

We are lucky to have one of the finest modular synthesizer shops in the world: [Control](ctrl-mod.com).  It affords you the opportunity to go and try modules out, play with huge modular synthesizer cases, buy and sell used modules, ask questions, meet kind, extremely knowledgeable people, and learn about synthesis!  This week, your assignment is to go to Control and learn about a specific module via an in-person demo, and spend some time playing around with the various cases in the store.  The module you will learn about is based off of the number you were assigned in class - though please explore the shop and ask lots of questions!  Consider organizing a field trip with some of your classmates as well!

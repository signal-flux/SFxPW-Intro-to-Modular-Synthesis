1. [Week 1: Modular Thinking](#Week-1)

## Pre-Class Prep Work

1. Install [VCV Rack](vcvrack.com) on your laptop computer.  Once installed, log-in by clicking the `Library` dropdown in the toolbar and using the credentials `itmspw@gmail.com` and password `synthesis`.  Once logged in, press `Library > Update all`.
2. Read [Chapter 0 - Introduction to Modular Thinking](./Chapter-00/chapter00.md).  We will be going over all this (and more!) in our first class.  
3. Review these very short web demos on [pitch](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/amplitude), [amplitude](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/pitch) and [playing with both](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/play-with-amplitude-and-pitch).
4. Please download the VCV Rack Lab patches for [Chapter 1](./Chapter-01/patches/ch01_vcv_labs.zip), [Chapter 2](./Chapter-02/patches/ch02_vcv_labs.zip) and [Chapter 3](./Chapter-03/patches/ch03_vcv_labs.zip) - we will be doing these in class, so please have the files downloaded on your computer when you arrive.  Right- or opt-click the links and select `Save as ...` to save the .zip files.
5. Remember to bring your laptop, headphones, and notetaking materials!



## Week 1

### Modular Thinking

*This week, we will learn about the physics of sound and the fundamental concepts of modular synthesis like signal flow, patching, control voltage, and modulation.  We will also get familiar with VCV Rack, an open-source modular Eurorack modular synthesis emulator.*

### Agenda

- **Introductions**
- **Course Overview**
- **Modular Thinking**
  - The Parameters of Sound
  - The Electronic Transmission of Sound
  - So What's a Patch?
  - Control Voltage and Modulation
- **Modular Building Blocks**
  - Oscilloscopes: Visualizing Voltage
  - Oscillators: Frequency and Amplitude
  - Attenuators & Voltage Controlled Amplifiers: Amplitude Control
- **Break** (5 minutes)
- **Lab - Introduction to VCV Rack**
  - Adding modules
  - Deleting modules
  - Using patch cables to connect modules
  - 'Multing' patch cables
  - Using the VCV Rack oscillscope to visualize constant voltages, LFOs, and Oscillators
  - Getting sound out of VCV Rack.
  - Using VCOs, LFOs, Attenuators/Attenuverters, and VCAs

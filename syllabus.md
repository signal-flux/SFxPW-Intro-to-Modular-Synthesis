# Intro to Modular Synthesis @ Pioneer Works

0. [Pre-Class Prep Work](#Pre-Class-Prep-Work)
1. [Week 1: Modular Thinking](#Week-1)

## Pre-Class Prep Work

1. Install [VCV Rack](vcvrack.com) on your laptop computer.  Once installed, log-in by clicking the `Library` dropdown in the toolbar and using the credentials `itms@signalflux.org` and password `synthesis`.  Once logged in, press `Library > Update all`.
2. Read [00 - Introduction to Modular Thinking](./Chapter-00/chapter00.md).  We will be going over all this (and more!) in our first class.  
3. Review these very short web demos on [pitch](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/amplitude), [amplitude](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/pitch) and [playing with both](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/play-with-amplitude-and-pitch).
4. Remember to bring your laptop, headphones, and notetaking materials!

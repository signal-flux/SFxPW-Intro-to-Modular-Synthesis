# Intro to Modular Synthesis @ Pioneer Works







## Pre-class Prep Work

- Install [VCV Rack](vcvrack.com) on your laptop computer.  Once installed, 
- Read *Chapter 00 - Intro to Modular Thinking.*  We will be going over all this (and more!) in our first class.  
- Review these very short web demos on [pitch](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/amplitude),  [amplitude](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/pitch), and playing with [both](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/making-changes/play-with-amplitude-and-pitch).
- Remember to bring your laptop, headphones, and notetaking materials!

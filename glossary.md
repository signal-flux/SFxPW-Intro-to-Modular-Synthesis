## Week 1

| Term                                  | Definition                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Pitch*                               | How 'high' or 'low' a sound is; each key on a piano corresponds to a different pitch; the primary difference between two notes played by the same instrument (e.g. two different keys on the piano, two different strings on a guitar) is their pitch.  Sequences of pitches can create melodies. |
| *Timbre*                              | The quality or character of a sound; how harsh or clean it is; bright or soft; the primary difference between two notes with the same pitch but played by different instruments is their timbre (e.g. middle C played by a piano, a guitar, or a human voice are all the same pitch, but have different timbres). |
| *Loudness*                            | The apparent intensity of a sound; how loud or quiet it is.  |
| *Voltage*                             | How electricity is measured.  Voltage has a magnitude (e.g. size) and polarity (e.g. positive or negative).  Sound waves can be transmitted as electrical voltages which mirror the sound waves.  Modular synthesizers send audio between modules as voltages; modular synthesizers also use constant or slowly changing voltages to control other parameters of other modules. |
| *Signal*                              | Electrical information transmitted from one module to another over a patch cable; may be audio or control information. |
| *Input*                               | Incoming information/signals are received by a module at its input.  The module determines its output based on the state of its inputs.  Some inputs are *jacks* which you can plug a cable into to feed the input with a signal from another module. Other inputs may be interactive, like knobs, faders, switches, buttons, or touchplates. |
| *Output*                              | Signals leave a module at its output jacks.  Output signals may be sent to other modules, or possibly to speakers to be turned into sound.  The output signals are created based off of each module's individual rules for processing and converting its inputs into outputs. |
| *Signal Flow*                         | The path signals take as they are travel through the system from origin to final destination.  The patch cables carry signals as voltage from outputs towards inputs. |
| *Control Voltage (CV)*                | Control voltage signals are relatively slowly changing and can be used to change a parameter of another module by sending it to the corresponding input.  For instance, control voltage may set the pitch of a sound generating module, or slowly increase and decrease the volume of a sound processing module. |
| *Modulation*                          | Using control voltage to change a parameter on a module (for instance, pitch or loudness) over time. |
| *Audio-rate Voltage*                  | Voltage that changes very quickly (greater than 20 times per second, or > 20 Hertz).  When connected to a speaker, the voltage pushes the speaker cone back and forth very quickly, creating sound waves which we ultimately hear as sound.  Sound generating modules create audio-rate voltages, while sound processing modules expect audio-rate voltage inputs. |
| *Oscilloscope*                        | Used to visualize voltages.  Displays *Time* on the X-axis and *Voltage Amplitude* on the Y-axis.  *Time Scale* is used to zoom in and out along the X-axis, displaying a long swath of time to visualize voltages that change slowly (control voltage), or a narrow band of time to view voltages which change quickly (audio-rate voltage) |
| *Oscillator*                          | Creates a voltage which moves up and down in a repeating pattern.  One repetition of the pattern is known as a *cycle* or a single *oscillation*.  The shape of each cycle is known as the *waveshape*. The time it takes to complete one cycle is known as the *period*.  The number of cycles completed in one second is known as the *frequency*, and is measured in *Hertz (Hz)*, aka *cycles per second (cps)*.  A greater period means a smaller frequency, since each cycle takes longer and thus fewer cycles are completed in one second.  Similarly, a shorter period means a higher frequency.  If the frequency is greater 20 Hertz, the oscillating voltage can be sent to a speaker and turned into sound; as the voltage goes up and down, it pushes the speaker cone back and forth, which in turn pushes air back and forth, creating sound waves.  Higher frequencies corresponding to higher pitches.  Different waveshapes create different timbres. |
| *Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)* | An oscillator whose frequency can be controlled by an external control voltage.  Usually has a knob which sets the base frequency.  Sending in positive voltages to the *frequency modulation (FM)* input will increase the frequency of the oscillator.  Negative voltages will decrease the frequency.  Some VCOs may also have voltage-controllable waveshape, allowing you to use CV to affect the timbre.  When the frequency is greater than approx. 20 Hz, the oscillation is fast enough to be sent to a speaker and heard as sound. |
| *Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO)*      | Creates an oscillation which is too slow to be used as sound, but can be used instead to control parameters of another module (for instance, making a sound brighter or darker in a repeating pattern). |
| *Amplitude*                           | How large or small a changing voltage is.  For quickly-changing audio-rate signals, the "amplitude" refers to the maximum and minimum voltage which the signal reaches.  The amplitude of an audio-rate signal determines its loudness.  Two audio-rate signals with identical waveforms but different amplitudes will have the same timbre but different loudness because they push the speaker cones back and forth in the same pattern but to different maximum and minimum displacements.  The amplitude of control voltages is often referred to as the "depth" of modulation. |
| *Attenuator*                          | Changes the amplitude of an incoming signal without changing the shape of it in time; vertically stretches or shrinks a voltage.  A knob sets how much the incoming signal is attenuated (made smaller) before passing through to the output.  Fully CCW corresponds to full attenuation (input signal is not passed, 0V output), while fully CW corresponds to no attenuation (original signal passes through unaffected at its full amplitude).  Since amplitude corresponds to loudness of an audio signal, attenuators can be used to make audio signals louder and quieter.  Can also be used to change the amplitude of control voltages in order to change how much they affect a destination parameter; this is known as controlling the  "depth" of modulation.  When fully attenuated, the incoming control voltage will not pass through the attenuator and will have no affect on the destination parameter (no depth).  When the attenuator is fully 'open', the control voltage passes straight through the attenuator and will fully modulate the destination parameter (maximum depth). |
| *Voltage-Controlled Amplifier (VCA)*  | Like an attenuator, but instead of using a knob to set attenuation, a VCA can use a control voltage to set the attenuation/amplification of an incoming signal to process.Expects two inputs: a voltage to process, and a control voltage which determines how to change the amplitude of the signal to process. |
| *Hertz (Hz)*                          | 1 Hz = 1 cycle completed per second                          |
| *Frequency*                           | How many cycles an oscillator completes in a single second. Measured in Hertz (Hz), aka cycles per second (cps) |
| *Inverter*                            | Flips the polarity of an incoming voltage, but leaves magnitude unaffected: turns positive voltages negative and turns negative voltages positive.  +3.4V becomes -3.4V, and -2.5V becomes +2.5VV. |
| *Attenuverter*                        | Similar to an attenuator, but it can also invert voltages.  At noon, incoming voltage is fully attenuated.  Between noon and CW, attenuation is decreased just like on an attenuator (with no attenuation reached fully CW).  Between noon and CCW, the incoming voltage is inverted before it is attenuated; attenuation of the inverted voltage decreases as the knob moves from noon to fully CCW.  Original signal is passed to the output at its fully amplitude but inverted when the knob reaches CCW. |
| *Unipolar Voltage*                    | A signal which is only positive or only negative, e.g. an LFO whose range is 0V to +8V; alternatively, 0V to -8V would also be unipolar.  *Uni*- means 'one' and *-polar* refers to polarity (positive or negative). |
| *Bipolar Voltage*                     | A signal which can be both positive and negative, e.g. an LFO whose range is -5V to +5V.  *Bi*- means 'two' and *-polar* refers to polarity (positive or negative). |
| *Modulation Depth*                    | The extent of a change in a parameter caused by modulation; how far a parameter under voltage control moves from its normal position. The farther the control voltage pushes the parameter, the greater the  modulation depth. |

## Week 2

| Term                      | Definition                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Trigger*                 | A short spike of voltage that jumps from 0V up to a "high" voltage level and then immediately falls back to 0V.  The "high" voltage can be anywhere from +5V to +10V, depending on the module.  Triggers can be used to tell other modules when to "start" an event (like playing back a sample, or initiating an envelope generator) or advance to the next stage of an sequence (like a CV or gate sequencer).  The peak voltage of the trigger generally does not matter, only that the peak voltage is high enough to cross over the *threshold* voltage of the receiving trigger input.  The length of a trigger (time spent above the threshold) does not matter, just its *rising-edge* (the moment when crosses from below the threshold to above the threshold).  Triggers are "momentary." |
| *Rising-Edge*             | A gate/trigger's transition from 0V to the high voltage level; the moment when a trigger/gate crosses above the threshold voltage. |
| *Trigger/Gate Threshold*  | The voltage level which a signal must cross over to be considered "high" or "active" (in binary terms).  Trigger inputs on various modules may have different thresholds (sometimes referred to as sensitivities), but generally thresholds are between +0.8V and +2.5V. |
| *Gate*                    | A gate is a pulse of voltage which jumps from 0V to a "high" voltage level (+5V to +10V, depending on the module) and stays there for some amount of time before dropping back to 0V.  When a gate crosses above the threshold voltage, it is said to "go high" and when the gate crosses back below the threshold voltage, it is said to "go low."  Gates can be used to turn other actions on as long as they are high and then turn off as soon as they go low, for instance playing back a sample as long as the gate as high and stopping playback as soon as the gate goes low.  Unlike triggers then, the length of time which a gate spends above the threshold voltage does matter, and is called its "pulse-width."  NB: Gates can be used as triggers, in which case the pulse-width is ignored and only the rising-edge matters. |
| *Pulse-Width*             | The amount of time a gate spends above a threshold voltage.  When "triggers" are sent to a "gate input", the trigger can just be considered a gate with an extremely short pulse-width. |
| *Clock*                   | A clock is a steady stream of triggers or gates at a constant rate; it can be used to advance sequencers, trigger envelopes, combined with other clocks to create rhythms, synchronize modules, and more. |
| *Clock Modulation*        | Converting a steady streams of gates/triggers, aka a clock, into a new pattern or "rhythm" of pulses which is somehow synchronized to the original clock. |
| *Clock Divider*           | One example of a clock modulator.  Takes one clock input and generates a new clock output.  A clock divider outputs 1 pulse for every *n* input pulses: for example, a clock divider set to "4" will output 1 pulse for every 4 input pulses.  You can think of real-life clocks as a useful reminder: if the second-hand is the input, and the minute-hand is the output, then the clock itself acts as a clock divider since the minute-hand will advance 1 tick for every 60 ticks of the second-hand. |
| *Envelope*                | In the broader context of sound, an *envelope* is the "shape", "contour," or "morphology" of a sound, i.e. how it changes as it progresses.  For instance, a plucked string is silent before it plucks; when it gets plucked, it immediately spikes in loudness, and then slowly decays into silence.  The trajectory of its volume - silence, loudness spike, decay into silence - is known as its *volume envelope* because it encloses and defines the lifespan of the sound. |
| *Envelope Generator (EG)* | In the context of modular synthesis, an envelope may be applied to any input parameter (for instance, pitch of an oscillator, cutoff of a filter, loudness of a VCA) to further sculpt a sound in time.  Envelope generators are modules which create envelopes to send to other parameters.  When "at rest" an envelope generator sends out 0V.  Envelope generator expect a trigger or gate to signal the start of an envelope: the envelope generator will then output a signal which starts at 0V, rises to a high voltage level (e.g. +8V) in a fixed amount of time (the *attack* phase) and then falls back to 0V in a different amount of time (the *release* phase).  Envelope generators typically have knobs which allow you to set the length of each phase independently.  The triggered envelope's rising and falling voltage may be used to open and close a VCA, create a pitch spike on oscillator, or control any other parameter which you wish.  It may have additional intermediate phases beyond the attack/release phases.  Envelope generators are typically classified by acronyms referring to the stages they have, eg. "AR EG" (attack-release envelope generator),  "ASR EG" (attack-sustain-release envelope generator), or "ADSR EG" (attack-decay-sustain-release envelope generator). |
| *Attack*                  | The initial phase in which an envelope generator rises from 0V to its maximum voltage level (e.g. +8V).  The duration of this phase is the "attack-time."  The attack phase is initiated when the EG receives a trigger or gate signal. |
| *Decay*                   | An intermediate phase in which a gate-controlled envelope generator falls from its maximum voltage to an intermediate *sustain-level*.  The duration of this phase is the "decay-time." |
| *Sustain*                 | An intermediate stage in which the envelope generator is held at a fixed voltage level, the *sustain-level* as long as the input gate is held high. |
| *Release*                 | The final phase in which the envelope falls from its maximum level (or the sustain-level) to 0V. |
| *Interval*                | The distance between two notes/pitches.  In terms of frequency, this is actually the *ratio* of two frequencies, not their numerical difference.  For example, the note A4 is at 440 Hz, while A3 is at 220 Hz.  In terms of semi-tones, or piano keys, we would say that A4 is one octave, or 12 semitones above A3, however in terms of frequencies, we would say that they are in a 2:1 ratio. |
| *Octave*                  | Any interval which is equal to 12 semitones forms an octave, or any two frequencies which are in a 2:1 ratio.  Since any two pitches which form an octave are thought of as the same note, an "octave" can also be thought of as the collection of all possible pitches between any two identical pitches, e.g. between C3 and C4.  For instance, you can break a piano up into repeating  groups of 12 keys which each define a different "octave." |
| *Scale*                   | A collection of intervals (usually less than one octave) compared to which sound musically pleasing together; all of the duplicates of the collection of notes in other octaves are also said to be "within the scale." |
| *Volt-per-octave (V/oct)* | A system for generating control voltage to precisely controlled a voltage-controlled oscillator's frequency.  Scales of notes only allow very specific, precise musical intervals; the volt-per-octave tuning standard allows oscillators to accurately change its frequency to produce these musical intervals (i.e. frequency ratios).  Typically VCOs have a knob which sets their base pitch, or frequency.  When sending 0V to the *V/oct* (volt-per-octave) input of an oscillator, the oscillator simply continues playing at its original frequency.  However, a +1V increase at this input will result in a doubling of the frequency; in other words, it sets the oscillator to the same note but one octave above.  This is where the name "one-volt-per-octave" comes from: a +1V increase at the input will always double the frequency of the oscillator, which is equivalent to shifting the pitch up one octave.  So if an oscillator is tuned to C2 using its pitch knob, then sending in 0V will correspond to C2, 1V will correspond to C3, 2V will correspond to C4, and so on. Other intervals, like a major third or perfect fifth are mapped to their own specific voltages in the V/oct tuning standard based off their frequency ratios. |
| *Sequence*                | A signal composed of various "steps" of constant voltages which each last for some fixed fixed duration before advancing to the next step, e.g. "+2V for 3 seconds, +3.3V for 4 seconds, +1.2V for 1 second."  The transitions from one voltage level to the next are instantaneous, creating sharp jumps and drops in voltage as the sequence advances from one step to the next.  When viewed on an oscilloscope, a sequence forms a pattern of horizontal and vertical lines (steps and transitions, respectively) joined by right-angles reminiscent of a staircase; this is the origin of the term "step."  Sequences are often used to control the pitch of an oscillator to create a melody, but they can also be used to control any pattern.   Sequences may repeat after some number of steps ("looping"), or they may be "generative" and evolve over time.  Each step may have the same duration, or each step may have different durations. |
| *Sequencer*               | A sequencer is a module which allows you to control the voltage level of each step in a sequence.  Often, sequencers will allow you to ensure that the output voltages are *quantized*, i.e. forced to voltage levels which will only produce intervals from within a specified scale (this is useful for controlling oscillator pitch tonally or microtonally).  Some sequencers allow you to specify the voltage level of each step directly, while other sequencers allow you to control parameters of pattern generating algorithms which set the level for each step.  Sequencers usually have a clock input which advances the sequence to the next step every time a pulse arrives. |
| *Quantizer*               | A quantizer allows the user to set a scale, or collection of allowed intervals.  It then takes an incoming voltage and shifts the voltage to the closest voltage level which matches a V/Oct level from the specified scale. |
| *Mixer*                   | A mixer combines multiple inputs into a single output by adding them together.  With audio signals, this corresponds to creating a single output in which all of the input signals can be heard simultaneously if patched to a speaker.  Generally, a mixer has attenuators on each of its inputs to control the level (for audio, this means volume) of each signal.  When used to combine CV, a mixer can be used to combine multiple modulation sources into a single signal for a destination parameter, e.g. to combine envelopes with LFOs to control the loudness of an amplifier.  When used to mix CV, the mixer's attenuators control how much of each modulation source is passed to the output, and thus how much effect the corresponding modulation source will have on the destination parameter. |
| *Unity Mixer*             | A unity mixer does not have any attenuators.  It adds all input signals together at their original amplitudes, creating an equal mix of the input signals. |

| Term                              | Definition                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Fourier Analysis/Synthesis*      | Any periodic (repeating) waveform - no matter the waveshape - can be created by mixing together sine waves whose frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency (i.e. the original frequency of the waveform).  Carefully controlling the amplitudes of the sine waves creates the desired waveform.  More complex sounds may require more sine waves than just the *harmonics* (frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental). |
| *Harmonic*                        | A sine wave whose frequency is an integer (whole-number) multiple of the fundamental frequency aka the 1st harmonic. |
| *Partial*                         | A sine wave in a sound's spectrum whose frequency is a different than the fundamental frequency (all harmonics are partials, but not all partials are harmonics). |
| *Spectrum*                        | A representation in the frequency domain of the various sine waves needed to create a complex sound (as well as their amplitudes).  It shows the amount of energy needed at each frequency (i.e. the amplitude of each sine wave) needed to create the sound. |
| *Frequency Domain*                | X-axis is frequency; Y-axis is amplitude (a.k.a. energy).  Viewing a sound in the frequency domain allows you to see its spectrum and understand its harmonic content. |
| *Spectrogram*                     | Uses three dimensions to represent how a sound's spectrum changes over time.  The X-axis is time, the Y-axis is frequency and the z-axis is energy (usually color is used rather than depth). |
| *Time Domain*                     | X-axis is time; Y-axis measures voltage magnitude.  This allows us to see the waveshape of a sound as it shows the voltage rising and falling as time progresses. |
| *Waveshape*                       | The visual shape of a signal's graph as a function of time (i.e. its representation in the time domain). The four most common are sine waves, square waves, triangle waves, and sawtooth waves. |
| *Noise*                           | A signal with energy at all frequencies; no harmonic structure.  Different "colors" of noise are made depending on the distribution of energy across the frequencies. |
| *Voltage-Controlled Filter (VCF)* | A device that modifies a sound by acting on it in the frequency domain - i.e. it modifies a sound's spectrum.  It attenuates frequencies above or below a specific *cutoff frequency*. A *lowpass* filter passes all of the frequencies below its cutoff and reduces the level of the frequencies above that cutoff. A *highpass* filter passes all frequencies above its cutoff and attenuates the lower frequencies below the cutoff. A *bandpass* filter allows frequencies around the cutoff to pass through and reduces frequencies that are above and below the cutoff. The strength of filtration is determined by the filter *slope*: the lower the slope, the less aggressively it attenuates filters below or above its cut off. |
| *Subtractive Synthesis*           | Adjusting the timbre of a sound by removing harmonic content with filters. |
| *Cutoff Frequency*                | The frequency at which a filter's attenuation of a spectrum becomes substantial. |
| *Resonance*                       | Filters actually amplify frequencies right at the cutoff instead of leaving them unchanged. When the resonance of a filter becomes great enough, the filter will begin to generate a sine wave oscillation at the cutoff frequency without any input signal at all! This is known as self-oscillation. |
| *Wavefolding*                     | A type of waveshaping; unlike subtractive synthesis, the timbre of a sound is changed by adding harmonics rather than removing harmonics.  Wavefolders change a signal when it crosses over a threshold: as it does so, it mirrors, or folds, the voltage above the threshold back down below it.  When the folded version crosses below a lower threshold, the signal gets folded back up.  As a signal's gain or bias increases, so will the number of folds.  More harmonics are added. |
| *Distortion*                      | A gain effect achieved by overloading an input, i.e. increasing its gain a very large amount in order to push circuitry to its limits. The result is usually a compressed, gritty, harsh tone.  Harmonics are added.  usuallly the result of either soft- or hard-clipping the signal. |
| *Delay*                           | Delay is a  time-based audio effect that mimics echos.  An “echo” occurs when a sound is repeated multiple times after it first occurs, usually at a decreasing volume each time.  A delay line works by receiving a signal, holding it for some amount of time (the *delay time*) before sending it to the output.  The delayed signal is also sent back to the input at a lower volume, resulting in the sound being delayed a second time but at a lower volume. The number of repeats or echos is determined by the *feedback gain*. |
| *Reverb*                          | Reverb naturally occurs when a sound hits many surfaces and reflects back to the listener. Each reflection takes a slightly different amount of time to reach the listener.   Each reflection will also have a slightly different amplitude and filtered waveshape depending on the material it reflected off of. Together, these clouds of reflections create the reverberant ambience of a space; they sound like a smeared, diffused echoing tail of the original sound.  Reverb can also be applied artificially to a sound to give it a sense of space.  *Pre-Delay* controls the amount of time it takes for the first reflection to reach the listener.  *Decay Time* controls the amount of time it takes the reflections to entirely fade out.  *Damping* or *Absorption* controls how much filtration is applied to the reflections.  More advanced reverbs may have more extensive filter controls for the feedback or *diffusion network.* |
| *Dry Signal*                      | The clean, unaffected signal before it passes through a processing or FX unit. |
| *Wet Signal*                      | The fully processed sound that results from applying an effect to an input. |
| *Dry/Wet*                         | A control that allows you to blend an output between the original dry signal and the processed wet signal. |
| *Clock Modulation*                | Converting a steady streams of gates/triggers, aka a clock, into a new pattern or "rhythm" of pulses which is somehow synchronized to the original clock. |
| *Euclidean Rhythms*               | Rhythms generated by distributing a determined number of hits as evenly as possible across a determined number of steps.  Combinations of Euclidean rhythms are core elements of many musical traditions from all over the world.  *Euclidean Steps*/*Length:* the number of steps in the pattern.  *Euclidean Fill/Trigs*: the number of pulses in the pattern. *Euclidean Offset/Rotation:* determines where the first hit in the pattern occurs (shifts the pattern forward/backward in time). |
| *Reset*                           | Sending a pulse to a "reset" input will reset a sequencer or rhythm generator to its first step.  This is useful for synchronizing devices which may have different repetition frequencies. |
| *Polyrhythms*                     | A combination of two or more different sets of rhythms played against each other which do not subdivide into each other evenly. |
| *Phasing*                         | When looping patterns of two different lengths occur simultaneously, going "into and out of phase," - that is to say, the relationship between their start points is always shifting since they are looping at different frequencies.  Sequences can phase, rhythms can phase, and LFOs can phase! |
| *Sample and Hold (S+H)*           | A sample and hold (S/H) module has two inputs: a signal that is being sampled, and a trigger input that indicates when the first input should be sampled (aka frozen in place). When a trigger is received, the current voltage at the first input is sampled (measured) and held (stored), and presented at the output. This stable voltage is held until a new trigger is received. S+H can turn any signal into stepped sequence!  Pairing two LFOs to create a phasing, evolving sequence is a classic technique.  Another classic use of the S+H is to create random steps by patching noise into the S input. |
| *Slew Limiter*                    | *Slew limiters* smooth out changes in a voltage. The output voltage is like a “laggy” version of the input voltage: it takes time to catch up (*slew*) to the input. A slew limiter has two main parameters: the *rise-time* and *fall-time*.When the input voltage increases, the output voltage rises to the new voltage in the amount of time specified by *rise*. When the input voltage decreases, the output voltage falls to the new voltage in the amount of time specified by *fall*. SLs can be used to smooth out random sequences, create glissando/slides, and much more! |

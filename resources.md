## Recommendations 
### RTFM (read the f***ing manual) 
The best way to get to know a module before and in conjunction with​ using it is to get comfortable with its manual. As tedious as it can be, reading the manual usually answers most of our fundamental questions about what a module does and how it should function. As you, hopefully, get deeper into modular synthesis, you will find that there are many, many options to choose from to achieve your goals. RTFM can help you make an informed choice by giving you insight into a module’s design, interface, and capabilities!

### Patch Notes 
That there is no save feature for a hard won patch is part and parcel of modular synthesis. To save yourself frustration but mostly to get better at understanding your own process and sound, be sure to document your patches.

A few options available to you: take a photo and add to a folder for all your patches, create a “patch sheet” specific to your synthesizer, recreate and save on Modular Grid, use Patchbook markup language (see web resources), or simply take physical or virtual notes.

# 3: Voltage-Controlled Amplifiers

This chapter will introduce you to another core building block of synthesis: the voltage-controlled amplifier.  We previously used attenuators to change the amplitude of signals, however we could only use the knobs of the attenuators to set the amplitude of the incoming voltage.  The primary purpose of the VCA is to use the voltage level of one input signal to control the amplitude of another input signal.

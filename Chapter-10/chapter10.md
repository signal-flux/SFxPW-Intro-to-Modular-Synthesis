# 10: Clock Modulation

This chapter will introduce you to a few clock modulation techniques for generate new rhythms out of constant clock pulses!

When you are ready, move on to the [next chapter](..Chapter-11/chapter11.md)! 

## Labs

Right-click (or alt/opt-click) on the links below; then click `Save as ..` to download the two VCV Rack labs.  Make sure you are logged in to the class VCV Rack account before you begin: use credentials `itmspw@gmail.com` (password: `synthesis`) and hit `Library > Update plugins` before you begin.  Once you are logged in and have downloaded the labs/updated your plugins, double-click the first lab in your file browser, or open it using VCV Rack's `File > Open` dialog.

### Clock Modulation

*Clock modulation* converts a steady streams of gates/triggers, aka a clock, into a new pattern or "rhythm" of pulses which is somehow synchronized to the original clock.

### Clock Dividers

*Clock Dividers* output 1 pulse for every *n* input pulses.  Some clock dividers may automatically reset all outputs to a 0 count after the longest division pulses, while others will let all counters run independently.

Some clock dividers will allow you to change the division on each output, or even rotate the divisions between adjacent outputs.

### Euclidean Rhythms

*Euclidean rhythms* are a unique form of clock modulation generated by distributing a determined number of pulses as evenly as possible across a determined number of steps.

*Euclidean Length/Steps*: The number of steps in the pattern

*Euclidean Fill/Trigs*: The number of pulses in the pattern.

*Euclidean Offset/Rotation*: Determines where the first hit in the pattern occurs (shifts the pattern forward/backward in time)

Combinations of Euclidean rhythms are core elements of many musical traditions from all over the world.  

[Here's Godfried Toussaint's famous paper on Euclidean Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf).

[Here's a web demo (we did not make this one) which visualizes Euclidean Rhythms](https://dbkaplun.github.io/euclidean-rhythm/)

### Resets

*Reset* inputs allow you to set a sequencer or rhythm generator to the first step in its sequence or pattern.  This is very useful for synchronizing many different devices together, or for offsetting sequences/patterns in relationship to each other by sending different devices separate reset triggers. 

### BPM

*BPM* stands for beats-per-minute, and is the primary unit for measuring tempo, i.e. musical speed.

### PPQN

*PPQN* stands for "parts-per-quarter-note."  A 16th note clock would be considered 4 PPQN since there are 4 16th notes per one quarter note.  An 8th note clock would be considered 2PPQN because there are two 8th notes per quarter note.  

Many modules expect a clock input to drive them forward through a sequence or pattern.  Some of these modules need clocks at a certain speed to make sure they advance correctly and stay in sync with other modules.  For instance, if a sequencer can generate 32nd notes, it probably would need an 8 PPQN clock to make sure that each 32nd note happens at the correct point in time!

### Topograph and Mutable Grids

The *Topograph* module used in lab 10.3 is based off of *Mutable Instruments Grids*.  Right click the module in VCV Rack and click on its manual (in the plugin submenu) to learn more! Be sure to check out the [Grids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/) manual for a more detailed over.
